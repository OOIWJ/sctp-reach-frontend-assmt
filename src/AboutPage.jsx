      <h1>About Us</h1>

      <p>
        The lives of ALL children are enhanced through shared experiences and friendships with peers who may or may not have disabilities.
        In addition, inclusive practices foster self-determination for children with disabilities. In support of a more inclusive world, We teaches inclusive practices to individuals and organizations who serve children to change their attitudes and practices. We training breaks down barriers to inclusion and builds confidence in serving ALL children.
      </p>
      <p>
        Learning about inclusion enriches the lives of ALL who participate and increases understanding and acceptance of disabilities as a natural part of life.
        We provides best-in-class inclusion training on-site and online. We provides observations, consultations and recommendations to ensure organizations are confident in serving ALL children, regardless of ability.
